# JAX-RS/Jersey server with OpenAPI

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using an
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org), you can easily generate a server stub.

This is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled JAX-RS server.
This example uses the [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/) framework.
Jersey is used as JAX-RS implementation, `io.swagger:swagger-jersey2-jaxrs` is used to derive the OpenAPI Specification from the annotated code.

To run the server, please execute the following:

```
mvn clean package jetty:run
```

You can then view the OpenAPI v2 specification here:

```
http://localhost:8080/MJUNKIN_1/VDYP-File/1.0.0/swagger.json
```

Note that if you have configured the `host` to be something other than localhost, the calls through
swagger-ui will be directed to that host and not localhost!

## Docker

Docker is required to run the back end test suite.

### Install on Ubuntu

#### Remove old versions

```
for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker containerd runc; do sudo apt remove $pkg; done
```

#### Set up Docker APT repo

```
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

#### Install Docker

```
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

#### Verify install

```
sudo docker run hello-world
```

This should sdownload a container and run it showing a confirmation message that docker is working.

#### Set user permissions

```
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Log out and back in

#### Verify permissions are working

```
docker run hello-world
```

This should work the same way as it did without `sudo`.
